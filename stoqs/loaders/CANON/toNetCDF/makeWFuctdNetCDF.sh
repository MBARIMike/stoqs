# Shell script to make a local copy of original underway CTD data files for uctdToNetcdf.py to
# make .nc files and then copy them back to the catalog.  The user will be prompted for the 
# password to $LOGIN@$RH.  Loads for previous campaigns may be commented so as to keep a record
# of conversions.
#
# For running on a Docker-based installation give the script a docker argument from the docker
# direcory, e.g.:
#   cd $STOQS_HOME/docker
#   ../stoqs/loaders/CANON/toNetCDF/makeWFuctdNetCDF.sh docker
