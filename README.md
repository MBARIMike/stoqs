STOQS is a geospatial database and web application designed to give oceanographers
efficient integrated access to *in situ* measurement and *ex situ* sample data.
See http://www.stoqs.org.

#### Getting started with a STOQS development system 

First, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
&mdash; there are standard installers for Mac, Windows, and Linux. (You will also need 
[X Windows System](doc/instructions/XWINDOWS.md) sofware on your computer.) Then create an empty folder off your 
home directory such as `Vagrants/stoqsvm`, open a command prompt window, cd to that folder, and enter these 
commands:

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stoqs/stoqs/master/Vagrantfile" -o Vagrantfile
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stoqs/stoqs/master/provision.sh" -o provision.sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```
The Vagrantfile and provision.sh will provision a development system with an NFS mounted
directory from your host operating system. If your host doesn't support serving files via
NFS (most Windows hosts don't support NFS file serving) then you'll need to edit these files 
before executing `vagrant up`. Look for the `support NFS file serving` comments in these 
files for the lines you need to change.

The `vagrant up` command takes an hour or so to provision and setup a complete CentOS 7 
STOQS Virtual Machine that also includes MB-System, InstantReality, and all the Python data science 
tools bundled in packages such as Anaconda.  You will be prompted for your admin password
for configuring a shared folder from the VM (unless you've disabled the NFS mount).  All connections to this VM are 
performed from the the directory you installed it in; you must cd to it (e.g. `cd
~/Vagrants/stoqsvm`) before logging in with the `vagrant ssh -- -X` command.  After 
installation finishes log into your new VM and test it:

```bash
vagrant ssh -- -X                        # Wait for [vagrant@localhost ~]$ prompt
export STOQS_HOME=/vagrant/dev/stoqsgit  # Use STOQS_HOME=/home/vagrant/dev/stoqsgit if not using NFS mount
cd $STOQS_HOME && source venv-stoqs/bin/activate
export DATABASE_URL=postgis://stoqsadm:CHANGEME@127.0.0.1:5438/stoqs
./test.sh CHANGEME load noextraload
```

In another terminal window start the development server (after a `cd ~/Vagrants/stoqsvm`):

```bash
vagrant ssh -- -X                        # Wait for [vagrant@localhost ~]$ prompt
export STOQS_HOME=/vagrant/dev/stoqsgit  # Use STOQS_HOME=/home/vagrant/dev/stoqsgit if not using NFS mount
cd $STOQS_HOME && source venv-stoqs/bin/activate
export DATABASE_URL=postgis://stoqsadm:CHANGEME@127.0.0.1:5438/stoqs
stoqs/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --settings=config.settings.local
```

Visit your server's STOQS User Interface using your host computer's browser:

    http://localhost:8008

More instructions are in the doc/instructions directory &mdash; see [LOADING](doc/instructions/LOADING.md) 
for specifics on loading your own data. For example, you may create your own database of an archived MBARI campaign:

    cd stoqs
    ln -s mbari_campaigns.py campaigns.py
    loaders/load.py --db stoqs_cce2015

You are encouraged to contribute to the STOQS project! Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for how to share your work.  Also, see example 
[Jupyter Notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stoqs/stoqs/blob/master/stoqs/contrib/notebooks)
that demonstrate specific analyses and visualizations that go beyond the capabilities of the STOQS User Interface.
Visit the [STOQS Wiki pages](https://github.com/stoqs/stoqs/wiki) for updates and links to presentations.
The [stoqs-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stoqs-discuss) list in Google Groups is also 
a good place to ask questions and engage in discussion with the STOQS user and developer communities.

Supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, STOQS undergoes continual development
to help support the mission of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institue.  If you have your
own server you will occasionally want to get new features with:

```bash
git pull
```

#### Production Deployment with Docker

First, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
on your system.  Then clone the repository; in the docker directory copy the `template.env` file to `.env` 
and edit it for your specific installation, then execute `docker-compose up`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stoqs/stoqs.git stoqsgit
cd stoqsgit/docker
cp template.env .env
chmod 600 .env      # You must then edit .env and change settings for your environment
docker-compose up
```
If the directory set to the STOQS_VOLS_DIR variable in your .env file doesn't exist then the 
execution of `docker-compose up` will create the postgresql database cluster, load a default 
stoqs database, and execute the unit and functional tests of the stoqs application.  If you
don't see these tests being executed (they will take several minutes) then check for error
messages.

Once you see `... [emperor] vassal /etc/uwsgi/django-uwsgi.ini is ready to accept requests`
you can visit the site at https://localhost &mdash; it uses a self-signed certificate, so your
browser will complain and you will need to add an exception. (The nginx service also delivers 
the same app at http://localhost:8000 without the certificate issue.)

The default settings in `template.env` will run a production nginx/uwsgi/stoqs server configured
for https://localhost in a Vagrant virtual machine. To configure a server for intranet or public serving of
your data follow the instructions provided in the comments for the settings in your `.env` file.
After editing your `.env` file you will need to rebuild the images and restart the Docker 
services, this time with the `-d` option to run the containers in the background:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

The above commands should also be done following a `git pull` in order to deploy updated
software on your server.

One thing that's good to do is monitor logs and check for error messages, this can be done with:

```
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Using STOQS in Docker

You can execute Python code in the stoqs server from your host by prefacing it with `docker-compose exec stoqs`
(Use `docker-compose run stoqs` to launch another container for long-running processes), for 
example to load some existing MBARI campaign data:

```bash
docker-compose run stoqs stoqs/loaders/load.py --db stoqs_simz_aug2013
```

(To load MBARI Campaigns you will need to have uncommented the `CAMPAIGNS_MODULE=stoqs/mbari_campaigns.py` 
line in your .env file. Make sure that you do not have a symbolic link named `campaigns.py` in the stoqs 
directory. This is needed only for a Vagrant development machine &mdash; it's best to keep the directory used
for a Docker deployment separate from one used for Vagrant.)

In another window monitor its output:

```bash
docker-compose run stoqs tail -f /srv/stoqs/loaders/MolecularEcology/loadSIMZ_aug2013.out
# Or (The stoqs code is bound as a volume in the container from the GitHub cloned location)
tail -f stoqsgit/stoqs/loaders/MolecularEcology/loadSIMZ_aug2013.out
```

You may also use `pg_restore` to more quickly load an existing Campaign database on your system.
For instructions click on the Campaign name in the top bar of a Campaign on another STOQS server, 
for example on [MBARI's Public STOQS Server](https://stoqs.mbari.org).
