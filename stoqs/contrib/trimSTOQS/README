Hi Mike,

I just wrote a fairly generic utility that compacts the TSV or CSV output from STOQS.
It also makes it more appropriate for importing into spreadsheet applications.
The basic idea is to replace:

context0   sample0parameter1
context0   sample0parameter2
context0   sample0parameter3

context1   sample1parameter1
context1   sample1parameter2
context1   sample1parameter3
...

with:

context0  sample0parameter1,sample0parameter2,sample0parameter3
context1  sample1parameter1,sample1parameter2,sample1parameter3

The utility is called trimSTOQS

In the case of my ESP roll and pitch data request, the STOQS TSV outputted 140MB
The trimSTOQS utility converted that to a 32MB  CSV file with the following command:

$  trimSTOQS name <makai2019erie.tsv  >makai2019erie.csv

It's written in 'C.  The above run took only 0.6 seconds on my desktop.

I've put the data files and the 'C' utility up in:

/tempbox/brent/erie2019

You can build it under Linux with the included Makefile or the command:

$  gcc -o trimSTOQS -O2 trimSTOQS.c

---

or on the Vagrant VM used for STOQS development:

$  gcc -std=gnu99 -o trimSTOQS -O2 trimSTOQS.c

or on a Docker installation:

$ cd $STOQS_HOME/docker
$ docker-compose exec stoqs /bin/bash -c "cd stoqs/contrib/trimSTOQS && gcc -o trimSTOQS -O2 trimSTOQS.c"
