    "Executing this Notebook requires a personal STOQS database. Follow the [steps to build your own development system](https://github.com/stoqs/stoqs/blob/master/README.md) &mdash; this will take about an hour and depends on a good connection to the Internet.  Once your server is up log into it (after a `cd ~/Vagrants/stoqsvm`) and activate your virtual environment with the usual commands:\n",

    "Loading this database can take over a day as there are over 40 million measurments from 22 different platforms. You may want to edit the `stoqs/loaders/CANON/loadCANON_september2013.py` file and comment all but the `loadDorado()` method calls at the end of the file. You can also set a stride value or use the `--test` option to create a `stoqs_september2013_t` database, in which case you'll need to set the STOQS_CAMPAIGNS envrironment variable: \n",

    "A little explanation is probably warranted here. The Dorado missions on 16-19 September 2013 sampled distinct water types in Monterey Bay that are easily identified by ranges of salinity. These water types contain different kinds of particles as identified by bbp700 (backscatter) and fl700_uncorr (chlorophyll). The previous command \"labeled\" MeasuredParameters in the database according to our understanding of the optical properties of diatoms, dinoflagellates, and sediment. This works for this data set because of the particular oceanographic conditions at the time.\n",
